            Gardening is one of those rewarding hobbies that connects us to nature, brightens up our spaces, and even
            improves our mood. But while many of us jump in with enthusiasm, there are some important gardening tips
            that often get overlooked — and these little details can make a huge difference in the health and beauty of
            your garden. Here are three things you probably didn't know about how to properly garden:
        </p>
        <h2 class="article__title">1. Not All Plants Like the Same Soil</h2>
        <p class="article__text">
            One of the biggest gardening mistakes is assuming that all plants thrive in the same type of soil. In
            reality, different plants have different soil preferences. Some love acidic soil, while others prefer
            alkaline or neutral pH. Some plants need well-drained sandy soil, while others thrive in heavier clay soil
            rich in nutrients.
        </p>
        <p class="article__text">
            Before planting, take a little time to research your plants' soil needs and consider testing your garden
            soil's pH. You can improve your soil's condition by adding organic matter like compost or using amendments
            tailored for your plants. This step will give your garden the best possible foundation for healthy growth.
        </p>
        <h2 class="article__title">2. Watering Too Much (or Too Little) Can Harm Your Plants</h2>
        <p class="article__text">
            Watering might seem straightforward, but it's one of the trickiest parts of gardening to get right.
            Overwatering can cause root rot and attract pests, while underwatering stresses plants and limits their
            growth.
        </p>
        <p class="article__text">
            The secret? Know your plants' watering needs and pay attention to the weather and soil moisture. For most
            plants, it's better to water deeply and less frequently, encouraging roots to grow deep and strong. Also,
            watering early in the morning or late in the evening helps reduce evaporation and fungal diseases.
        </p>
        <h2 class="article__title">
            3. Pruning Isn't Just for Looks — It's Essential for Plant Health
        </h2>
        <p class="article__text">
            Many gardeners underestimate the power of pruning. Regular pruning isn't just about keeping your plants
            neat; it encourages new growth, improves air circulation, and helps prevent disease. Knowing when and how to
            prune can make a huge difference.
        </p>
        <p class="article__text">
            For example, some plants bloom on old wood and shouldn't be heavily pruned in spring, while others benefit
            from hard pruning to promote fresh growth. Learning the pruning schedule for your specific plants will help
            keep your garden flourishing year after year.
        </p>
