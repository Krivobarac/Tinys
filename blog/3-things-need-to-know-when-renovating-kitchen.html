        <p class="article__text">
            Renovating your kitchen can be an exciting yet daunting task. It's a space where functionality meets style,
            and careful planning can make a world of difference. Whether you're aiming for a complete overhaul or just a
            few updates, here are three essential things to consider before diving into your kitchen renovation project:
        </p>
        <h2 class="article__title">1. Budgeting Wisely</h2>
        <p class="article__text">
            One of the first steps in any renovation project is setting a realistic budget. Your budget will dictate the
            scope of your renovation, from the quality of materials to the extent of changes you can make. Consider not
            only the cost of materials and labor but also unexpected expenses that may arise during the renovation
            process. It's wise to allocate a contingency fund of about 10-20% of your total budget to handle any
            surprises that may come up.
        </p>
        <h2 class="article__title">2. Designing for Functionality</h2>
        <p class="article__text">
            Your kitchen is not just a place for cooking; it's often the heart of the home where family and friends
            gather. When planning your renovation, prioritize functionality alongside aesthetics. Think about how you
            use your kitchen on a daily basis and design with efficiency in mind. This includes optimizing storage
            space, ensuring adequate countertop area for food preparation, and choosing durable materials that can
            withstand the rigors of daily use.
        </p>
        <p class="article__text">
            Consider the kitchen work triangle—comprising the sink, stove, and refrigerator—as a guiding principle for
            efficient layout design. This concept ensures that these three key areas are within easy reach of each
            other, streamlining your workflow in the kitchen.
        </p>
        <h2 class="article__title">
            3. Choosing the Right Materials
        </h2>
        <p class="article__text">
            The materials you choose for your kitchen renovation can significantly impact both the look and longevity of
            your space. From countertops to flooring, cabinets to appliances, each material option offers unique
            benefits in terms of aesthetics, durability, and maintenance requirements.

            <li class="article__list__item">
                <span>Countertops:</span> Options like granite, quartz, and butcher block each have their pros and cons
                in terms of durability and maintenance.
            </li>
            <li class="article__list__item">
                <span>Cabinetry:</span> Consider factors such as material (wood, laminate, etc.), finish, and hardware
                when selecting cabinets that complement your kitchen's overall style and offer ample storage.
            </li>
            <li class="article__list__item">
                <span>Flooring:</span> Choose flooring materials that are both durable and easy to clean, such as
                ceramic tile, hardwood, or luxury vinyl.
            </li>
        </ul>
