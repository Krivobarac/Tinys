        <p class="article__text">
            In homes across Tampa, St. Petersburg, Clearwater, and Largo, the kitchen has evolved far beyond its
            original purpose. It's not just where meals are made - it's where mornings begin, stories are shared, and
            quiet moments unfold over coffee. So when homeowners talk about kitchen remodeling, it's not simply about
            cabinets and countertops. It's about reimagining how you live. With Tiny's Remodeling, we're here to bring
            that vision to life.
        </p>
        <h2 class="article__title">Where Do You Begin?</h2>
        <p class="article__text">
            The best remodels don't start with measurements. They start with questions
        </p>
        <ul class="article__list">
            <li class="article__list__item">
                What do you want this space to feel like?
            </li>
            <li class="article__list__item">
                What frustrates you every day?
            </li>
            <li class="article__list__item">
                What do you wish you had more of-light, storage, connection?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article__text">
            The answers to these questions become the blueprint for your dream kitchen. At Tiny's Remodeling, we guide
            you through these important steps to ensure your remodel is tailored to your lifestyle and needs.
        </p>
        <h2 class="article__title">Style Matters - But So Does Function!</h2>
        <p class="article__text">
            In many homes across St. Petersburg and Clearwater, there's a pull toward open, sun-filled spaces that
            reflect the calm energy of coastal living. Natural tones, soft whites, and textures like wood and stone help
            echo that relaxed style. But remodeling isn't one-size-fits-all. Some Tampa kitchens aim for sleek
            minimalism, while others in Largo celebrate warmth, character, and durability - especially in family homes.
        </p>
        <p class="article__text">
            The beauty of remodeling is that you get to choose what works for you, and with the help of Tiny's
            Remodeling, we ensure your kitchen reflects your unique style.

            The Power of Layout
        </h2>
        <p class="article__text">
            Layout, too, is about rhythm. It's how you move from fridge to stove, the placement of your sink in relation
            to the view, and the island that becomes the heart of the space - whether you're chopping herbs or helping
            kids with their homework.
            A remodeling project gives you the chance to fix what never worked and create a layout that makes your daily
            life smoother and more efficient. With Tiny's Remodeling, we prioritize both style and functionality to
            bring you a space that feels just right.

        <h2 class="article__title">Lighting That Transforms</h2>
        <p class="article__text">Lighting That Transforms</p>
        <ul class="article__list">
            <li class="article__list__item">
                <span>Natural light</span> in the morning
            </li>
            <li class="article__list__item">
                <span>Focused task lighting</span> for cooking
            </li>
            <li class="article__list__item">
                <span>Warm pendant lights</span> to set the mood when guests arrive
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article__text">
            Lighting is often overlooked, but it can completely transform how a space feels. Be sure to include it as an
            important element when planning your remodel. Tiny's Remodeling ensures your kitchen lighting is as
            functional as it is beautiful.

            Why Not Remodel Your Kitchen &amp; Bathroom Together?
        </h2>
        <p class="article__text">
            As you plan, think bigger than just the kitchen. Many Tampa Bay homeowners are now choosing to remodel both
            their kitchen and bathroom at the same time - not only for convenience but for cohesion. When materials,
            colors, and fixtures flow seamlessly from one space to another, your home feels more complete and balanced.
            With Tiny's Remodeling, you can achieve the perfect harmony between these two essential spaces.
        </p>
        <h2 class="article__text heading">Execution: Turning Your Vision into Reality</h2>
        <p class="article__text">
            Of course, a great design is only half the journey. Execution matters just as much. That's why choosing a
            local remodeling team that understands the architecture and style preferences of Tampa, Clearwater, and the
            surrounding areas is key. Experienced professionals don't just install - they guide, anticipate, and bring
            clarity to what could otherwise be a stressful process.
            With Tiny's Remodeling, we handle every step with care and precision to make sure your project is completed
            on time and within budget.

        <h2 class="article__text heading">Let's Bring Your Dream Kitchen to Life</h2>
        <p class="article__text">

            opportunity to rethink how your home serves you. It's more than just renovation - it's reinvention. Kitchen
            remodeling is never just about the kitchen. It's about creating a space that meets you where life happens.
            And in the end, isn't that the kind of design worth investing in? Let Tiny's Remodeling help make your dream
